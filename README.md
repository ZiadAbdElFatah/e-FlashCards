# e-FlashCards
## Overview ##

The e-FlashCards is a Java-based application that allows users to create and study flashcards for quizzes. It consists of two main components:

1.**QuizCardBuilder**: A GUI application for creating flashcards. Users can input questions and answers, save them to a file, and clear the current set of cards.

2.**QuizCardPlayer**: A GUI application for studying the flashcards. Users can load a saved set of flashcards, view questions, and reveal answers sequentially.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, GUI development using Swing, file I/O operations, and object-oriented design.

## Features ##

**QuizCardBuilder**

* Create flashcards with questions and answers.
* Save flashcards to a file for later use.
* Clear the current set of flashcards.
* User-friendly interface with text areas for input and buttons for navigation.

**QuizCardPlayer**

* Load saved flashcards from a file.
* Display questions one at a time, allowing users to reveal answers.
* Navigate through flashcards using the "Next Card" button.
* Handle end-of-deck scenarios gracefully.

## Technologies Used ##
* **Java**: Core programming language.
* **Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **File I/O**: For saving and loading flashcards to/from text files.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, classes, and objects for managing flashcards and application logic.
